**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-domain-videojoin.md
**Status**: Active (Version 1.3.1 – welcome version token is `requirement-cpp-version`)
**Area**: domain
**Key**: `requirement-domain-videojoin`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This requirement is the domain surface Single Source of Truth for HalloTui: the welcome message, and the two ways a person sees it.

Typed verbs and empty argv are owned by `requirement-python-cli-interface`. The screen that shows menu row 1 is owned by `requirement-cpp-tui`. Class `Tui` owns the welcome sentence. The about page is `requirement-python-about`.

This file remains the sole Active `requirement-domain-*`. Headings and pictures in the root user document are `requirement-python-readme`.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** HalloTui shows one welcome line, either printed by `hello` or shown from menu row 1.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Person who wants the welcome line | `hallo-tui hello` |
| The other role | The text menu, row 1 | `requirement-cpp-tui` |
| Not this file | The rounded menu frame, pip install, and the log folder | TUI, packaging, and logging requirements |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| One welcome line, `Welcome to HalloTui 1.0.0.` | Joining media, an encoder, a scan of the working directory |
| Typed `hello`, which prints that line and does not draw the menu | A front-board row that lists files |
| Menu row 1 **hello**, which shows that same line on the menu | `join` and `list-videos` as verbs |
| Help and about as real pages | A downloaded-script installer advertised on the about page |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `hallo-tui hello` | The terminal | The welcome line. No menu |
| Menu row 1 | The text menu result page | The same welcome line |
| `hallo-tui about` | About page | Name, version, what the product does, how to start it |
| `hallo-tui help` | Help page | The same capabilities, including what this product does not do |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Print the welcome | One line on the terminal. The menu does not open. The process returns 0. | `hallo-tui hello` |
| Show the welcome | On a terminal, open the menu and choose **1**. The result page shows the same line. | `hallo-tui`, then `1` |
| Read about | You see HalloTui, version 1.0.0, the welcome summary, and how to start the program. | `hallo-tui about` |

## 2. Core Rules / Requirements (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Pillar A — The welcome line

The welcome sentence is `Welcome to HalloTui 1.0.0.` `Tui::helloText` is the only place that builds it. The version token is `kVersion` in `src/main/cpp/project.h`, owned by `requirement-cpp-version`. This file does not keep a second version literal.

| Step ID | User action | Inputs | Output / effect | Ops SSOT |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| D-01 | Print the welcome | typed verb `hello` | The sentence on standard output. Return 0. The menu does not open | this file + CLI |
| D-02 | Show the welcome | menu row 1, kind `hello` | The same sentence on the result page | this file + TUI |

**Routing:** `hallo-tui hello` **MUST** run D-01 and **MUST NOT** run D-02. Front-board row 1 **MUST** run D-02. Bare `hallo-tui` on a terminal opens the front board and **MUST NOT** run D-01 or D-02.

**Non-goals:** joining media, calling FFmpeg or any other encoder, listing files in the working directory, `join`, `list-videos`, a folder prompt, a shell installer, file-operand flags.

Complete invocation sample this pillar owns:

```text
hallo-tui hello
```

`hallo-tui hello` prints the welcome line and returns 0, with or without a terminal. It does not draw the menu.

### 2.2 Pillar B — What this product does not do

| Feature area | Domain role | Full law |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Welcome line | One sentence, shared by the verb and row 1 | this file |
| No media join | **MUST NOT** concatenate, re-encode, or publish a media file | this file |
| No file list | **MUST NOT** scan the working directory to list files for the person | this file |
| No encoder | **MUST NOT** require or invoke `ffmpeg` | `requirement-video-ffmpeg-pipeline` is Retired |

### 2.3 Pillar C — Help

`hallo-tui help` and `hallo-tui --help` **MUST** list the welcome behavior and **MUST NOT** list `join`, `list-videos`, or an encoder. Help is a typed verb. It is not a numbered menu row.

The help page **MUST** include:

| Help row | Text intent |
|----------|-------------|
| Welcome | `hello` prints one line and does not draw the menu |
| Menu | On a terminal, `hallo-tui` with no words shows the front board. Row 1 shows the welcome line |
| Absence | This program does not join media or list files in the folder |

### 2.4 Pillar D — About

The domain sentence on the about page is `Show a welcome message`. The page, the host check, and the star box are `requirement-python-about`.

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Product name | HalloTui |
| Version | `1.0.0` (`kVersion`) |
| Domain summary | Show a welcome message |

The page **MUST** use that domain sentence. The runtime-tools line **MUST** be `none`. It **MUST NOT** name FFmpeg.

### 2.5 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Product / package name** | `HalloTui` |
| **Console command** | `hallo-tui` |
| **Welcome sentence** | `Tui::helloText` in `src/main/cpp/tui.cpp` |
| **Menu row** | Front row 1, kind `hello`, short `hello` |
| **VERSION** | `1.0.0` (`project.h` and `project.ini`) |
| **Absent** | verbs `join` and `list-videos`, FFmpeg |
| **CLI SSOT** | `requirement-python-cli-interface` |
| **Screen** | `requirement-cpp-tui` |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` |

### 2.6 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: The welcome line is explicit, and empty argv does not print it.
- **Principle 5 – SSOT**: One Active domain file. The sentence is built in one method.
- **Principle 1 – Caution**: Join, file listing, and an encoder stay non-goals.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, `hello` and the menu run as the normal user. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to print the welcome line. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Do not scan the folder in order to say hello.
- **Intentional:** One sentence, two surfaces.
- **Anti-fragile:** README, help, about, the terminal, and row 1 name the same line.
- **Over-protect:** Keep the sole Active domain file.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Add `join`, `list-videos`, FFmpeg, or a working-directory file listing back without an explicit user order and a new revision of this file.
2. Add a shell installer or root elevation as silent domain behavior.
3. Create a second Active `requirement-domain-*` without superseding this one.
4. Give the terminal and menu row 1 two different welcome sentences.
5. Make empty argv print the welcome line or start a media job.

**Violating this rule is a critical domain regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | `video-join hello` prints `Welcome to VideoJoin <version>.` and returns 0 |
| AC-2 | That verb does not draw the menu |
| AC-3 | Menu row 1 is `hello` and shows the same line |
| AC-4 | `join` and `list-videos` are unknown verbs |
| AC-5 | Help and about do not describe a join or an encoder |
| AC-6 | This file stays the sole Active domain SSOT |

| **TP-HELLO-02** | `tests/test_hello.py` | have | `join` and `list-videos` are unknown. Help does not name an encoder |
| **TP-HELLO-03** | `tests/test_hello.py` | have | Row 1 shows the same welcome line on the result page |

## Terminologies

### Project target version

**Definition:** Project target version is the user-confirmed product version string (typically MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, for example 1.0.0 or 1.7.0) that agents must collect from the user (or confirm from an existing product root README.md parse). After it is written into product root README.md, that file is the single source of truth for this field, displayed once in the product README header kit as the shields.io Version badge. It is not hardcoded into skills, requirements, templates, or terminology files.

**Human daily-life explanation:** Project target version is the user-confirmed version string shown once as the README Version badge. Skills do not own it.

**Daily-life example:** The edition number printed on a cookbook's cover; the inner chapters should match, but the cover is what you asked to print.
